## My process

1. Created repository on GitHub and initialized version control with git.

2. Created Html structure and added content of the page such as text, images, buttons.

3. Styles my web page with css using a mobile first approach. Used flexbox for the layout of the page. Once I finished the mobile styles I then used a media query to add the desktop styles.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
